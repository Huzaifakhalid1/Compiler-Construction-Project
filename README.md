RUN 'streamlit run app.py' and paste sample.dsl code there for GUI

1.	Paste you matrix in dsl on  sample.dsl
2.	Run ‘python main.py’ on terminal.
3.	After an output.py file created automatically Run ‘python output.py’ command on terminal.
4.	Then Run ‘streamlit run app.py’ on terminal and paste dsl code same as in sample.dsl file there.
